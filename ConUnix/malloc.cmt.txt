(1) Why the members of the 'structure map', m_size and m_addr, declared as pointers?

    struct map
    {
        char *m_size;
        char *m_addr;
    };

   Pre K&R did not support 'unsigned int'.
   However, by declaring a symbol 'char *', declared symbol's value was  treated as if it has 'unsigned int' type.

   See the example how it is used in malloc() code.
   
	int
   	malloc (struct map *mp, int size)
	{
	    register int a;
  	    register struct map *bp;

  	    for (bp = mp; bp->m_size; bp++)
    	        if (bp->m_size >= size)
      	          a = bp->m_addr;
	     ....
	}

(2) What is the first argument of the function mfree() ?

    	 void
    	 mfree(struct map *map, int size, int aa)
    	 {
		...
    	 }
