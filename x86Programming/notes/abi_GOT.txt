3-35 Coding Examples

 To maximize text shareing, shared objects conventionally use position-independent code, PIC.
 PIC contains no absolute addresses.

 PIC relies on two techniques:
  1) Control tranfer instructions hold offsets relative to the extended instruction pointer, EIP.
     An EIP-relative branch or function call computes its destination address in terms of the
     current instruction pointer, not relative to any absolute address.

  2)
