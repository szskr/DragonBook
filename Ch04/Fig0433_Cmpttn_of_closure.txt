;; The Closure Operation
;;

If I is a set of item for a grammar G, then closure(I) is the set of items
constructed from I by the two rules:

1. Initally, every items in I is added to closure(I).
2. If A -> a.Bb is in a closure(I) and B -> r is a production, then add the item
   B -> .b to I, if it is not already there. We apply this rule untilno more new
   items can be added to closure(I).


;; P.223
;; FUNCTION closure(I)
;;
FUNCTION closure (I)
BEGIN
  J := I;
  REPEAT
    FOR each item A->a.Bb in J and each production,,
      B -> r of G such that B -> .r is not in J
      DO
        add B -> .r to J
  UNTIL no more item can be added to J;
  RETURN J
END
