The Closure Operation
 If I is a set of items for a grammar G, then closure(O) is the set of items constructed from
 I by the two rules:
 
   (1) Initially, every item in I is added to closure(I).
   (2) If A -> a.BC is in closure(I) and
          B -> g    is a production, then add the item
	  B -> .g   to I, if it is not already there. We apply this rule until no more new items can be added to closure(I).


Example 4.34 Consider the augumented expression grammar:
 E' -> E
 E  -> E + T | T
 T  -> T * F | F		(4.19)
 F  -> (E) | id

If I is the set of one item {[E' -> .E]}, the closure(I) contains the items:
   E' -> .E
   E  -> .E + T
   E  -> .T
   T  -> .T * F
   T  -> .F
   F  -> .(E)
   F  -> .id
